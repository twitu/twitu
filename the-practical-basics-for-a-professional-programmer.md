# The Practical Basics

A professional programmer only needs to know a few practical basics, but the few practical basics they must know.

## Know your text editor

You will spend 80% of your time navigating, reading and understanding code and the rest 20% editing code. Editing code is different from English, lots of weird symbols, weird indentations, non-Englishy text. You want 0 friction between thought to code. You want the editor to be an extension of you.

Learn vim or emacs[^1], do some touch typing, practice your sublime text keyboard shortcuts, burn the Microsoft word chords into your brain. Whatever. Just don't be an editor n00b.

## Know your version control system (VCS)

Version control systems are gods gift to humanity. You can easily save, share, patch and revert changes. You can clearly see the what lines has been changed and associate each change with some extra context.

Learn git[^2], mercury, jujutsu, Word versioning whatever. Please, I beg you, don't save files as Final_Final_Presentation_latest_updated.zip.

## Know your damned tools

If you don't know your tools what are you even doing? There's more to a carpenter than just hammer and nails.

* Fixing a python bug use a debugger
* Editing CSS use Chrome dev tools
* Optimizing performance flamegraph the CPU, waterfall the network requests. 
* Writing FP code? Use a good LSP and type checker
* Querying data? Use a workbench that connects with database and shows clean output tables

It's much more fun when you know your damned tools well. And if you're lucky enough to find an integrated development environment (IDE) which neatly bundles all these tools use it.

## Know your APIs

And finally the crowning jewel of the practical basics. If you don't know the APIs for your computing domain, I'm very very disappointed. APIs aren't just for the web they are literally everywhere. It's the bedrock for your computing model.

* Making a web application? You can get data, post data, put data, proxy requests, redirect requests, return 200+, 400+, 500+ status codes.
* Designing a website? You have buttons, text, input fields, forms and tables. You can centre, float, outline, pad, color, animate them and make it accessible[^3] with appropriate tags.
* Writing some high performance code? Doing some parallel logic? You can scatter, gather, map, fold, reduce the data
* Need to optimize it? Time your IO vs CPU, flamegraph your CPU workload, benchmark your logic with good data, identify memory allocation bottlenecks

I don't know what you do. Figure it out. Read the docs. Grow a strong computing model in your head.
