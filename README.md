## My simple web page 😇

🧑‍🎓 I'm **working on the [MLscript language](https://github.com/hkust-taco/mlscript/)** at the [TACO research group](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~parreaux/). It implements a sophisticated type system that infers the most general type, the principal type, for an expression.

💻 I enjoy topics related **compilers, type systems and programming languages** implementation. On the side I contribute to open source projects in Haskell or Rust 🦀.

✍️ Occasionally, I **write about my projects or topics** I have explored to some depth. Below are two you may find interesting.

* Developing an intuitive understanding of the **what? and how? of ffi** by [Building in Rust for Python 🔗](./tales-from-ffi.md).

* A 3-part **series about graphics programming in Rust** where I simulate a 3d flock of boids
    * [Part 1 - A fistful of boids](./a-fistful-of-boids.md)
    * [Part 2 - For a few boids more](./for-a-few-boids-more.md)
    * [Part 3 - The school, the boid and the rusty](./the-school-the-boid-and-the-rusty.md)

* An [AWS Open Source Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-strong-typing-practices-to-declare-a-large-number-of-resources-with-aws-cdk/) about using TypeScript's type system for **declaring resources in CDK**

**Comments are welcome** and encouraged. You can file an issue or directly comment in the commit specific file.

🎨 I explored a few blogging options but finally decided not go down that rabbit hole. Github and markdown is a "sasta, sundar, tikau" combination (trans. thrifty, beautiful and lasting) that suits me well.
